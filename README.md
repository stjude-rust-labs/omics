**NOTE: this crate is highly experimental and is not ready for production or even really 
experimenting with. There are many things I already don't like about or are arguably
up incorrect within the existing implementation. As I find time, I'll continue to update
the crate with these changes.**

## üé® Features

The `omics` crate provides foundational data structures for working with omics data. The
following features are included and are top-level goals of the project.

- **Coordinate systems (`omics::coordinate`)**. Provides multiple genomic coordinate
  systems including both a 0-based, half-open coordinate system (also known as the
  _interbase_ coordinate system) and 1-based, fully-closed coordinate system (also known
  as the _in-base_ or just _base_ coordinate system).
- **Biologically relevant molecules (`omics::molecule`).** Representations of molecules
  relevant in omics including smaller compounds (e.g., nucleotides) and larger
  polymers (e.g., DNA, RNA).
- **Variation (`omics::variation`).** Facilities for expressing common types of
  variation including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions
  (INDELs), structural variations (SVs), and copy number variations (CNVs).

## üñ•Ô∏è Development

To bootstrap a development environment, please use the following commands.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:stjude-rust-labs/omics.git
cd omics

# Build the crate in release mode
